{"text": "high - salt has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease . in this study , we investigated the effect of high - salt on the production of inflammatory mediators by arpe-19 cells and the possible mechanisms involved . arpe-19 cells were cultured with lps in dmem to which extra nacl had been added ( 20  mm and 40  mm ) . a) The addition of sodium chloride ( 1 mmol/ l ) did not influence their growth and (b) lps treated with salt ( 40 mm ) significantly (p<0.01) induced an IC 50 value of 11 nmol TNFa/mL. The addition of lps in dmem for the addition of the salt ( 40 mm ) resulted in a significant increase in the IC 50 in the range of 25 - 33 nmol TNFa/ml.\n\nThe mechanism by which the salt influences arpe-19 cells immunity is not known, however, the authors suggested that the increase in the production of TNFa may result from lysosome-remodeling effect of lps. In this study, arpe-19 cells have been treated for 24 hours with lps at different concentrations which resulted to significantly different results. lps-treated arpe-19 cells grew as compared to untreated cells in the range of 40.3 - 57.3% of the initial culture volume. This increase in proliferation indicates that lps acts via the activation of arpe-19 cells immune mechanism.\n\nLps has also been recently used for the anti-tumour effect in cancer cell line. in this study, we found that Lps can bind to EBOV-1 and -2 and promote the cell death", "prompt_len": 347, "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "aim : the aim of the following study is to find out the prevalence of abnormal spermatozoa and associated functional parameters in clinical semen samples of sub - fertile males with the tobacco chewing habit.settings and design : retrospective study was conducted at infertility unit of a tertiary health care center , in a period of 3 years.materials and method : semen of 642 males were analyzed ; of them 194 men ( 30.2% ) were tobacco chewers and they were grouped according to their intensity of chewing ( < 10 and  10 packets / day ) .\n\nResults : there was an increased prevalence of abnormal spermatozoa (P =.066) and abnormal morphology (P =.012) in tobacco chewers compared to those who do not chew. In accordance to this, abnormal sperm DNA was also observed in tobacco chewers: in 5.3% (7/194) males there were abnormal or abnormal DNA content. This is not the case in non chewers (43.6% or 10/144). And among the normal samples, an increased content of spermatozoa DNA was observed (P =.003) among the non chewers (11.2%), whereas among the tobacco chewers there was an increase in sperm DNA content only (P =.05).\n\nDiscussion : by using a multivariate approach, the authors found several findings that supported the hypothesis that tobacco chewing may cause an increased prevalence and abnormal sperm characteristics among some populations:\n\n· The authors also have observed an association between poor quality semen and excessive use of tobacco and a high age of men and an excessive tobacco chewing habit.This may provide a possible biological explanation for the increased prevalence of normal spermatozoa in smoking groups, and also for some subfertility factors.\n\n· Smoking is associated with lower total testosterone levels, which in fact may be in part responsible for the effects of sperm mot", "prompt_len": 541, "label": "gpt2"}

An analysis of changes in Census question wording over recent decades reveals the challenges in trying to count and describe this fast-growing population.An estimated 48 million Hispanics are now living in the U.S., or almost 16% of the population. Hispanics are the nation's largest minority group, having surpassed African Americans in number in 2001. By 2050, the Hispanic/ Latino population is expected to make up more than a quarter of the U.S. population.

Many more Hispanics (6.0 million) were under age 18.
