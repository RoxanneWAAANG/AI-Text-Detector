{"text": "The decision overturned an earlier ruling by the High Court. The inquiry had said witnesses did not need legal representation, nor should it be met by public funding. In January, the High Court said that decision was wrong, but on Friday the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling. The inquiry is examining allegations of child abuse in children's homes and other residential institutions in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1995. It is the biggest child abuse public inquiry ever held in the UK. The witness, known as BP, wants to give evidence regarding alleged abuse she suffered while living in institutions run by the Order of the Sisters of Nazareth. She also wants to give evidence of being sexually abused by an outside and independent person (referred to in court as X) during the period when she was in care. She made an application for legal representation at the inquiry as it was envisaged that her allegations would be robustly rejected and challenged in public. BP has suffered from severe mental health issues and is currently serving a prison sentence.  She submitted that being questioned in public on her background could amount to a significant detriment being cast on her character. BP's request for legal representation was refused.  She then asked for an oral hearing before the chairman, Sir Anthony Hart.  Her application was again rejected. She challenged this decision by way of judicial review and the High Court ruled in her favour. However, that ruling was appealed by the HIA. ", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Census History: Counting HispanicsDespite the long history of Hispanic residents in the United States, there was no systematic effort to count this group separately in the Census until the late 20th century. An analysis of changes in Census question wording over recent decades reveals the challenges in trying to count and describe this fast-growing population.An estimated 48 million Hispanics are now living in the U.S., or almost 16% of the population. Hispanics are the nation's largest minority group, having surpassed African Americans in number in 2001. The growth of the Hispanic population this century is due mainly to births in the United States, not immigration from abroad, a reversal of the pattern over the previous four decades.There was a one-time inclusion of a \"Mexican\" race category in the 1930 Census, when forms were filled out by census-takers who went door to door. The first major attempt to estimate the size of the Hispanic population for the entire nation was in the 1970 Census, in which forms were completed by residents themselves. The question appeared on one of the two long-form questionnaires sent to a sample of the population, not the short form that everybody answered. The question asked: \"Is this person's origin or descent—\" and the response categories were: \"Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, Other Spanish,\" and \"No, none of these.\"This question did not work very well. The total count of 9.1 million reported in that census was about 500,000 less than other estimates for the Hispanic population. (See this page on the Census Bureau website for data and more history) Further, even this 9.1 million count was about 1 million higher than responses to the question by people of Hispanic origin. According to later research, a major problem was that hundreds of thousands of people living in the south or central regions of the U.S. mistakenly were included in the \"Central or South American\" category. As is its usual policy, Census reports on the Hispanic population in 1970 use the originally reported figures.Hispanic Question on the Short FormIn 1980, the question was moved to the short form that went to all households, and specified that it pertained to Hispanics: \"Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin or descent?\" The possible responses were: \"No (not Spanish/Hispanic); Yes, Mexican, Mexican-Amer., Chicano; Yes, Puerto Rican; Yes, Cuban; Yes, other Spanish/Hispanic.\" The Hispanic origin question followed the race, age, and marital status questions. (The previously problematic \"Central or South American\" category did not appear.)This question counted 14.6 million Hispanics and worked reasonably well. A few hundred thousand non-Hispanics apparently misinterpreted the question and attempted to identify as \"American\" by marking the \"Yes, Mexican, Mexican-Amer., Chicano\" category. Many actually circled the abbreviation \"Amer.\" to so indicate on the form. There also were several hundred thousand people whose place of birth, language, origin or descent suggested that they were Hispanic but who failed to indicate that they were of Hispanic origin. (This and other apparent errors were documented by researchers after the census was completed; as has generally been the case with decennial censuses, the", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Stanley Vernon Majors, 61, is suspected of shooting Khalid Jabara, 37, at his home in Tulsa on Friday. The Jabara family said Majors had repeatedly harassed them, calling them \"dirty Arabs\" and \"filthy Lebanese,\" referring to their Lebanese heritage. He also was accused of hitting Mr Jabara's mother with his car last year. The victim's family said they were \"outraged\" by the incident and police had failed in protecting them. According to a Facebook statement released by his sister, Victoria Jabara Williams, Mr Jabara had called police on Friday \"stating this man had a gun and that he was scared for what might happen.\" Police responded and left the neighbourhood without questioning Majors, and Mr Jabara was killed just eight minutes later while talking on the phone outside. \"The perpetrator was not unknown to us â€” he is our neighbourâ€” someone whom we continuously brought to law enforcement's attention,\" Victoria Jabara Williams's statement said. \"This suspect had a history of bigotry against our family. He repeatedly attacked our ethnicity and perceived religion, making racist comments,\" she added. Authorities found Majors hiding behind a nearby tree after the attack. Majors was taken into custody and is expected to be formally charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction. The Jabara family said Majors had harassed them since 2013, when Haifa Jabara was granted a protective order against him. She reportedly said he harassed her and \"is very racist towards foreigners and blacks,\" the Tulsa World reported. He was arrested and charged with violating the restraining order against him on 18 March, 2015, but released from jail after posting bond. But in September 2015, Haifa Jabara was hit by a car and left on the road with a broken shoulder, nose and other injuries. Police charged Majors in the hit-and-run, with assault and battery with a deadly weapon,  public intoxication, leaving the scene of a collision involving injury and violating a protective order. Majors was initially denied bail on the assault charge, but was granted bond in May after spending eight months in jail, according to the Tulsa World. Mr Jabara's family said Majors should have been charged with a hate crime after the hit-and-run incident. \"He should not have been released without monitoring,\" she wrote. \"Yet he was released and put back next door to us, the family he assaulted just months before,\" the statement said. \"This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes.\" The incident comes after an imam and his associate were shot and killed while walking from their mosque in Queens, New York.

{"text": "from your work?Risking giving too cliched of an answer, I would say I see the value of it from God and my faith in Christianity. I believe in the power of stories to change people's lives and how stories can be the vehicles for explaining massive truths. That's something I believe in general, regardless of religious implications. However, the truths that come out of me come from my belief in Christ. I try not to make preachy, or heavy handed fiction as I genuinely want everyone to be able to enjoy the stories I write, but since my life is so caught up in my faith, it just comes out. One of my favorite things about Christ was that he was a storyteller. He explained so much of himself through parables.
