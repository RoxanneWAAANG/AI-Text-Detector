In January, the High Court said that decision was wrong, but on Friday the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling. Mr Justice Brian McKenna agreed with the High Court that witnesses should have legal representation, but did not agree that the public should fund it. Mr Justice McKenna said the issue was \"a matter of some importance\" and there was a \"strong consideration\" to have public funding. In Mr Taher's case, he was allegedly shot in 1992, and it has taken almost three years to get the court to hear his case. His lawyer, Barry Doherty SC, said that was one of the reasons that the legal team had been funded privately. He said the decision overturning the previous ruling from the High Court was \"very welcome\" and that the matter could now be dealt with within the year that witnesses had told the court they would be available. \"You don't ask a witness", "prompt_len": 280, "label": "llama"}

An analysis of changes in Census question wording over recent decades reveals the challenges in trying to count and describe this fast-growing population.An estimated 48 million Hispanics are now living in the U.S., or almost 16% of the population. But Hispanics weren’t counted separately in the Census at all until the 1960 Census, and until 2000 Hispanics were referred to as “White” or “Hispanic” on census forms—and often included as part of another racial or ethnic category.

I believe in the power of stories to change people's lives and how stories can be the vehicles for explaining massive truths. That's something I believe in general, regardless of religious implications. If someone believes otherwise, they're just not going to get that one. What I've tried to do is be as honest as possible in explaining what's going on in the mind of an artist or writer. I can't really explain my faith or spiritual views any better than I can my artistic tastes or creative methodologies, and explaining either one makes it clear how someone is going to feel about the other one. I've worked in my religious views because I personally find them important (like my political viewpoint). I know others feel the same way and I understand why they would want to address it as such (like my personal beliefs).But as an artist, you have very little power over people's opinions of what you have to say.
